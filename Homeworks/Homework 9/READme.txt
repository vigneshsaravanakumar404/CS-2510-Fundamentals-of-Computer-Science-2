              MOVE THE SLIDER TO.
    Graphics Enhancements:
         - 3D cells when not revealed. Once revealed, they become flat. Much like the original game.
           This was done using some careful coloring changes painstakingly by hand.
         - Original color scheme for the numbers once revealed
         - 3D text for everything. This was done using the same layering technique as the cells.
    Hint Button:
         - When clicked, it will reveal a random cell that is mine.
           This is useful for when you are stuck and need a hint. (or you are someone who can't accept loss)
